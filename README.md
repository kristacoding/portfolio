## Description 

Using different react components, I created a personal profile holding basic information about me and projects that I worked on over the past six months at the UPENN Bootcamp. 
 
The Navigation and Footer components were created through corresponding folders and Javascript files. Using React.Router.Dom, I was then able to apply them to three pages throughout my portfolio without needing to recode them each time. 
 
The three pages in my portfolio are the Homepage, Portfolio, and Contact Me Page. The fourth page is a link to my resume that is able to be downloaded. The Homepage uses react components to create a picture on the left, basic information about me, and button links to the other pages. 
 
The Portfolio page was created from a JSON file that holds basic information about each project that I worked on during my 6 months at the UPenn Bootcamp. The information is then called through a project card that filters through each element of the JSON page. The Project card calls each specific element of the JSON at certain times to create images, titles, descriptions, and links. This will be continually helpful because when I want to add another project, I just have to add it to the JSON file. 
 
Finally, the Contact us page uses call information from the state, so that if you write your name in the first and last name sections, it will also show up next to the hello. Using Bootstrap elements, I am able to add more functionality to the contact us form. Currently, the contact form does not live anywhere, but the goal is to have it connect to a database.
